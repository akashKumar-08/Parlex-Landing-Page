# Parlex Effect  :- 

In the "Parlex Effect," one image typically moves slowly while the other moves faster, creating a parallax motion effect. This illusion of depth is achieved by having the foreground image move at a slower rate relative to the background image, giving the impression that objects in the foreground are closer to the viewer and therefore move more slowly than objects in the background.

The Parlex Effect can be achieved using various techniques, such as CSS animations, JavaScript libraries, or specialized animation software. By carefully controlling the movement speed and direction of each layer, designers can create visually compelling scenes that draw the viewer's attention and enhance the overall user experience.
